This app is a demonstartion of a new exploit which manipulates the "startActivity" Binder event in a way that lets the ActivityManagerService die. This will also cause all other system services to die.

The app allows you to check whether a device is vulnerable to the exploit. It is not intended to do any harm, it serves the purpose of a demo to show what the exploit looks like without abusing it.

Affected Android versions: Android 10 / Android 11
